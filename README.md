# Green Stock Analysis #
## Overview ##
Steve was impresssed with our ability to set up Macros to help him evaluate a few stocks over the past couple years. Through evaluating the total daily volume and the yearly return on these stocks Steve is confident in giving financial advise to his parents. Overall steve looks to use our code in the future to evalute larger sets of stocks, but before we pass it along, we are looking to refactor our code to allow him a more condesed version of everything we were able to put together so far.

Overall we see that our updated code runs in a fifth of the amount of time as our original code.

## Summary ##
The advantage to refactoring code is that it will increase the codes maintainablity by condesing it and allowing for easily readable code. The disadvantages to refactoring come because it is time consuming. Also, while reworking through code there maybe times when code is broken and parts will no longer work like they did previously.

We see the advantages of refactoring our code not only with the time saving but the overall maintainability. The code is easier to read and is condensed. We also found there to be times when our code did not work like it did previously and we had to debug. In the end, it was worth it as it did help our code.
